** What is a reactive form?

* Angular compoent life cycle
- constructor
    - ngOnchange
    - ngOninit
    - ngDoCheck
        - NGafterContentInit
        - NGafterContentChecked
        - NgAfterViewInit
        - ngAfterViewChecked
    -ngOnDestroy

* no performance difference between template and reactive

* Template driven forms are typically HTML first, bound w/ ngModel to the angular component
    - Async
    - event based
        - calling your validation on blur, writing your own errors.
    - code heavy / reptitve

* Reactive Forms
    - Synchronous
        - easier to test / unit test
    - uses rxjs
    - this.formBuilder.group(new Customer()) - creates the new form group
        - formBuilder is provided by reactiveForms
        - will try to model the form based off of the Customer object
    - Synchronous
    * Abstract Controls
        - Form Control
            -text input, checkboxes
        -Form group
            -address, product details, etc
        -form array
            -addresses, products, etc
    * Why Care?
        - Forms and models are closely aligned
            - reactive makes it impossible to have a control without a value behind it
        - group form controls together
        - powerful validation at any level

    * Validation
        - can dynamically add and remove validators
